// 031-earlysend — take a guest's commands to the wire the tick they exist.
//
// The candidate fix for the guest's input lag, and the arm the latency probe
// (030-netlatprobe) exists to measure. Retail drains the command list only from
// Network::update, which runs only on a logic tick -- 5 a second. So a guest
// command sits in TheCommandList for up to a whole 200 ms quantum before it even
// LEAVES the machine, and only then can the router bind it to a frame. The host
// pays nothing for this: it stamps and executes its own commands inside the same
// tick that wrapped them.
//
// This drains the list from the client half instead, which runs every engine
// tick (~33 ms). The hook sits immediately before the engine's own
// liteupdate(FALSE) at RVA 0x0006BA53, so anything queued here is flushed to the
// wire by the very next instruction of the retail path -- there is no second
// mechanism to add and no timer to tune.
//
// What it deliberately does NOT touch, because those are the ways this could
// change the game rather than fix it:
//   * the 5 Hz quantum (RVA 0x00682074). Game time per logic frame is the
//     compiled-in LOGICFRAMES_PER_SECOND, so raising the rate multiplies the
//     speed of the game. That is the naive trap, not the fix.
//   * the frame ceiling and its writers, and GameLogic's cadence. Commands only
//     arrive earlier; the router keeps its frame-assignment and ordering rules.
//     Earlier arrival can change which frame receives a command, which is why
//     the change requires multiplayer validation despite preserving the rules.
//
// Why draining twice in one tick is safe: the pump removes and destroys every
// message it takes (RVA 0x00682941), so a logic tick that pumps again after this
// one finds the list empty. GameLogic::update runs its command dispatch and
// clears the list only when its phase argument is 1, so an interpolation tick
// can never see a half-drained list either.
//
// There is no loader and no CRT here: tools/cave.py drops this into a section
// appended to the retail image. Addresses are absolute: fixed-base 0x400000
// image, DllCharacteristics 0x0000, so no ASLR.
